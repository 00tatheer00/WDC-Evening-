    <!-- <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket">
        <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that is played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre
            of
            which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three
            stumps. Two players from the batting team (the striker and nonstriker) stand in front of either wicket
            holding
            bats, with one player from the fielding team (the bowler) bowling the ball towards the striker's wicket from
            the
            opposite end of the pitch.</p>
